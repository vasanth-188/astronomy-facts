            "Black Holes: These are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity.",
            "The Milky Way: Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is a barred spiral galaxy containing over 200 billion stars. It is about 100,000 light-years in diameter.",

            "Exoplanets: These are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, some of which may have conditions suitable for life.",

            "Dark Matter and Dark Energy: About 27% of the universe is dark matter, which does not emit light or energy, and about 68% is dark energy, which is driving the accelerated expansion of the universe.",

            "Pulsars: These are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. They are incredibly dense and can rotate several hundred times per second."
